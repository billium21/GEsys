We're attempting to speed up the backing up of our files. This scrpit will rebuild the directory structure using the Treenode class, then package it up and send it to the backup. The backup checks the modification date on all the directories, and if a directory has been modified since the time on the same file in the backup, a robocopy command is created to copy that directory and all it's subfiles to the backup.
